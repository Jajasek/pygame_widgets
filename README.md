* Install pygame, on most systems by `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`.
   For further information see
   https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation.
* Copy the entire content of this repository in the folder `<your installation of python>/Lib/site-packages/pygame_widgets`.
* Now it should work - to test it you can run
   ```
   cd <your installation of python>/Lib/site-packages/pygame_widgets/examples
   python bouncing_ball.py
   ```
   It should print a few lines into console, and then it should generate a black
   window with a ball bouncing inside. If not, please contact me through github
